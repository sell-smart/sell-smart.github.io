## Why Pricing Matters More Than You Think
A 5% change in price often shifts profit more than a 20% change in sales volume.  
Yet most Shopify stores spend more time tweaking ad campaigns than reviewing their prices.  
Pricing isn’t about guessing what “feels right” — it’s about finding the balance between what customers are willing to pay and what keeps your margins healthy.

## Common Pricing Mistakes
- **Copying competitors blindly**  
  Just because another store charges $29.99 doesn’t mean you should. They may have different costs, suppliers, or customer bases.  
- **Equating more sales with more profit**  
  High volume can still mean thin margins — or even losses if discounts are too deep.  
- **Ignoring recurring customers**  
  Regular buyers notice price swings more than one‑time shoppers. Trust lost here is hard to rebuild.  
- **Skipping measurement**  
  If you don’t track how price changes affect both sales and margin, you’re just guessing.

## When Price Testing Works
Price testing makes sense if:
  - Most of your customers are one‑time buyers  
  - You have enough volume that differences show up quickly  
  - You can split products or regions without confusing customers  

In these cases, A/B tests or phased rollouts give you reliable signals.

## When You Can’t Test Directly
Testing is risky when:
  - Customers buy repeatedly (they may feel cheated by price differences)  
  - Sales numbers are too small to detect meaningful effects  

**Alternatives:**
  - Use controlled discounts to measure impact  
  - Look for natural experiments (competitor price moves, seasonal demand shifts)  
  - Monitor stockouts and promotions to see how sales respond

## What If You Have Very Little Data?
- Benchmark against competitor prices  
- Use hierarchical or Bayesian models to borrow strength from similar products  
- Track every transaction carefully  
- Consider bundling products to generate more observations
