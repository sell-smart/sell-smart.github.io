    "text": "I help companies improve business decisions through statistical modeling — especially in settings where data is messy, opportunities for experimentation are limited, and off-the-shelf solutions fall short.\nMy focus areas include demand modeling, price elasticity estimation, and forecasting. I build bespoke models using Bayesian methods, tailored to the structure of the business problem — particularly when standard tools can’t capture the complexity of real-world decisions.\nI’ve worked across B2C and B2B contexts in close collaboration with various stakeholders — always aiming to understand how the business and sales processes actually work, so models reflect what matters and make the most of limited data.\nOpen to freelance and consulting opportunities involving challenging modeling problems, including pricing optimization and marketing mix modeling.\nLearn more about me →\n\n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Hi, I’m Pavel Logačev\n\nI help businesses optimize prices and grow revenue with data. That means building models that make pricing decisions — not dashboards that sit unused.\nWhether you’re a retailer, a B2B supplier, or a direct-to-consumer brand, I work with you (or your agency) to identify pricing opportunities, model demand, and implement pricing logic that scales.\nI don’t just hand you elasticities — I deliver working solutions.\nGet in touch if you’d like to work together."

    "text": "What I do\n\n\nFrom pricing guesswork to pricing strategy.\nI support clients with:\n\nPrice optimization (margin or revenue focused)\nWillingness-to-pay modeling — even without clean sales data\nDemand forecasting with uncertainty estimates\nStockout detection and adjustment\nCompetitor benchmarking from scraped or third-party data\nA/B test design and analysis\nCausal inference for pricing, marketing, and product decisions\n\nI help you go from messy historical data to a robust pricing process.\n\n\nBusiness-first. Technically fluent.\nI build models that are:\n\nCustom-fit to your context, not off-the-shelf\nDesigned for messy, real-world data\nDelivered as ready-to-use pricing logic, files, or API endpoints\n\nMy goal is always the same: help you charge the right price — confidently, repeatedly, and at scale.\nI’m based in Berlin and work with clients across Europe and North America.\nI speak English, German, and Russian."
