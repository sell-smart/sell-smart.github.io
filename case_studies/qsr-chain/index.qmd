## The Challenge

A quick-service restaurant chain was seeing declining transactions and needed to understand why. The timing was complicated: the decline coincided with both macroeconomic pressures (inflation, cost-of-living concerns) and changes to their loyalty program. Leadership needed to know which factor was driving the drop — the answer would determine whether to adjust pricing strategy or revisit the loyalty program changes.

## The Approach

I built competing models to isolate the effects:

- **Model 1 — Loyalty indicators:** Included variables capturing the loyalty program changes and customer engagement metrics
- **Model 2 — Macroeconomic indicators:** Used CPI, unemployment rates, and other economic signals

By comparing model performance and coefficient significance, I could assess the relative contribution of each factor to the transaction decline.

Additionally, I supported:
- **Price optimization:** Similar to other hospitality engagements
- **Site re-banding:** Clustering locations for appropriate pricing tiers

## The Outcome

The analysis provided clarity on the drivers of transaction decline, allowing the business to make informed decisions about both pricing and loyalty program strategy.

## Key Insight

> When multiple things change at once, you can't just look at the trend and pick your favorite explanation. Structured model comparison helps separate signal from narrative.
