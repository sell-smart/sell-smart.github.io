## The Challenge

A **QSR chain** was seeing declining transactions. But why?

::: {.incremental}
- Macroeconomic pressures (inflation, cost-of-living)
- Recent changes to loyalty program
- Both happened around the same time
- Leadership needed to know which factor was responsible
:::

---

## The Approach

Built **competing models** to isolate effects:

::: {.incremental}
- **Model 1:** Loyalty program indicators + customer engagement metrics
- **Model 2:** Macroeconomic indicators (CPI, unemployment)
- Compare model performance and coefficient significance
:::

## Additional Work

Beyond the decline analysis:

::: {.incremental}
- **Price optimization:** Menu-level elasticity estimation
- **Site re-banding:** Cluster locations for pricing tiers

**Structured model comparison helps separate signal from narrative.**
