## The Challenge

A **building supplies wholesaler** had erratic discounting:

::: {.incremental}
- Sales reps giving wildly varying discounts
- Some discounts far larger than needed to close
- Margin erosion from inconsistent practices
- Similar customers getting very different treatment
:::

---

## The Approach

Segmentation at two levels:

::: {.incremental}
- **Customer segmentation:** Group by size, loyalty, purchase patterns → appropriate discount bands
- **Product segmentation:** Identify where discounts are justified vs. given away unnecessarily
:::

Goal: Clear guidelines that standardize behavior while allowing flexibility where justified.

---

## The Outcome

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.metric-card}
[Consistent]{.number}
[Discount framework]{.label}
:::
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.metric-card}
[Clear]{.number}
[Sales guardrails]{.label}
:::
:::
::::

Primary value was operational: reducing chaos of ad-hoc pricing decisions.

## Measurement Challenge

Impact is hard to quantify:

::: {.incremental}
- Margin improvement hard to isolate from other changes
- "Price consistency" has no clean metric
- Value is in process improvement, not a single number
:::

---

## Key Insight

> In B2B, the problem often isn't finding the "right" price.

It's preventing the erosion when every deal gets negotiated from scratch.

**Consistency builds trust with customers and protects margins.**
