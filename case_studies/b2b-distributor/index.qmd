## The Challenge

A technical components distributor selling to manufacturers and repair shops had grown to 8,000+ SKUs through acquisition. Pricing was a patchwork: some products used cost-plus, others matched competitors, many hadn't been reviewed in years. The sales team had broad discounting authority, leading to margin erosion on high-volume accounts.

Leadership wanted to professionalize pricing but faced two constraints: sparse transaction data on the long tail (60% of SKUs sold fewer than 50 units/year) and a sales culture resistant to "black box" pricing.


## The Approach

I developed a hierarchical pricing model that worked despite data sparsity:

- **Product hierarchy leverage:** Estimated elasticity at the category and subcategory level, then shrunk individual SKU estimates toward these priors — allowing even low-volume items to get sensible prices
- **Customer segmentation:** Identified price-sensitive transactional buyers vs. relationship accounts, enabling differentiated pricing without universal discounting
- **Willingness-to-pay signals:** Incorporated quote-to-order conversion rates and discount request frequency as proxies for price sensitivity
- **Transparent recommendations:** Every price change came with a confidence interval and plain-language explanation — "similar products show X% volume sensitivity" — to build sales team buy-in


## The Outcome

After 12 months:

- **8% average margin improvement** across the catalog
- **15% reduction in ad-hoc discounting** — sales team used model outputs as negotiation anchors
- **Long-tail monetization** — identified 400+ SKUs that were significantly underpriced relative to alternatives
- **Reduced pricing workload** — automated recommendations replaced quarterly manual reviews


## Key Insight

> B2B pricing isn't about finding the "right" price — it's about giving sales teams defensible anchors. A model that explains its reasoning gets adopted. A model that just outputs numbers gets ignored or overridden.
