## The Challenge

A technical components distributor with **8,000+ SKUs** had pricing chaos:

::: {.incremental}
- Patchwork of cost-plus, competitor-matching, and forgotten prices
- Sales team had broad discounting authority → margin erosion
- 60% of SKUs sold <50 units/year (sparse data)
- Sales culture resistant to "black box" pricing
:::

---

## The Approach

Developed a **hierarchical pricing model** that works despite data sparsity:

::: {.incremental}
- **Category-level estimation:** Shrink SKU estimates toward category priors
- **Customer segmentation:** Price-sensitive vs. relationship accounts
- **WTP signals:** Quote-to-order rates, discount request frequency
- **Transparent outputs:** Confidence intervals + plain-language explanations

## The Outcome

After 12 months:

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Average margin improvement | **+8%** |
| Reduction in ad-hoc discounting | **-15%** |
| Underpriced SKUs identified | **400+** |
| Pricing workload | **Automated** |

## Key Insight

> B2B pricing isn't about finding the "right" price — it's about giving sales teams **defensible anchors**.

A model that **explains its reasoning** gets adopted.

A model that just outputs numbers gets ignored or overridden.
