## The Challenge

A **200+ store grocery retailer** across three countries was using uniform pricing everywhere.

::: {.incremental}
- Underpricing in affluent urban areas
- Losing volume to discounters in price-sensitive regions
- Previous attempts based on gut feel failed
:::

---

## The Approach

Built a **zone-based pricing model** using 18 months of transaction data across ~4,000 SKUs.

::: {.incremental}
- **Store clustering:** 5 pricing zones by competition, basket size, demographics
- **Category elasticity:** Separated "known value items" from margin categories
- **Guardrails:** Maximum price differentials to avoid backlash
- **Phased rollout:** 3 test zones, 200 SKUs first

## The Outcome

## Key Insight

> Most retailers think "regional pricing" means charging more in rich areas.

The real opportunity is **surgical**: raise prices on items customers don't compare, stay sharp on the items they do.

::: {.highlight-box style="margin-top: 1em;"}
The zone structure matters less than understanding which products drive price perception.
