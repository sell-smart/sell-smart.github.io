## The Challenge

A **200+ store grocery retailer** across three countries was using uniform pricing everywhere.

::: {.incremental}
- Underpricing in affluent urban areas
- Losing volume to discounters in price-sensitive regions
- Previous attempts based on gut feel failed
:::

## The Approach

Built a **zone-based pricing model** using 18 months of transaction data across ~4,000 SKUs.

::: {.incremental}
- **Store clustering:** 5 pricing zones by competition, basket size, demographics
- **Category elasticity:** Separated "known value items" from margin categories
- **Guardrails:** Maximum price differentials to avoid backlash
- **Phased rollout:** 3 test zones, 200 SKUs first

## The Outcome

Six months after full rollout:

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Margin improvement | **+12%** |
| Annual value | **€2.1M** |
| Volume impact | **Flat** (no loss) |
| Competitor reaction | **Minimal** |

## Key Insight

> Most retailers think "regional pricing" means charging more in rich areas.

The real opportunity is **surgical**: raise prices on items customers don't compare, stay sharp on the items they do.

**The zone structure matters less than understanding which products drive price perception.**
