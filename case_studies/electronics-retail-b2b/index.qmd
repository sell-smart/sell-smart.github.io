## Project Overview
A leading European B2B distributor of IT/consumer electronics needed automated pricing.

- Goal: Integrate **WTP modeling** into daily price updates
- Scope: Tens of thousands of SKUs across regions/channels
- Constraint: Fragmented systems; full internal ownership required

---

## Challenges
- Data fragmentation (ERP, custom tools, BI)
- Inconsistent update frequency across channels
- High change volume (supplier costs, competition)
- Observational data only

---

## Solution Approach
- Custom pricing engine:
  - **WTP curves** from historical sales + competitor distributions
  - Rules for margin floors, stock, promo periods
  - Elasticity-aware adjustments
- Automated write-back to e-commerce front-end
- **Feedback loop** to update WTP/elasticities from performance

---

## Architecture (light)
- Integration: ERP + internal tools + competitor feeds + costs
- Modeling: Partial pooling for sparse segments; uncertainty on all outputs
- Deployment: Audit trail; override governance; on-prem ownership

---

## Results
- Single automated pipeline replacing manual workflows
- >80% manual effort reduction
- Margin consistency across regions/product lines
- Real-time reaction to cost/competition

---

## Business Value
- From days to minutes for price changes
- WTP-driven margin improvements
- Transparency and control without SaaS lock-in

---

## Key Takeaways
- Integration quality determines pricing velocity
- WTP must be refreshed continuously
- Automation frees teams to think, not wrangle data
