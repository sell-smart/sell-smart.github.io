## Project Overview
A quick-service restaurant (QSR) group operating in France sought to improve pricing at scale.

- Goal: Lift contribution margin without eroding demand
- Scope: Core menu, add-ons, bundles
- Constraints: No experiments; historical POS only; heavy bundling; interpretability required

---

## Challenges
- Sparse/zero sales for long-tail SKUs
- Combos mask item-level demand
- Region/site heterogeneity
- Promotions confound base price effects

---

## Solution Approach
- Estimate **local log–log demand curves** per item × site
- **Hierarchical pooling** across items/sites to stabilize sparse estimates
- **Seasonality + latent trend** decomposition to separate timing effects
- **Uncertainty quantification** for all elasticities and projections

---

## Architecture (light)
- Data: POS, product hierarchy, promo flags, costs
- Models: Hierarchical demand with partial pooling; seasonal/weekly components
- Delivery: Price scenarios, margin/volume trade-offs, governance for overrides

---

## Results
- Identified under/over-priced items by region
- Produced **scenario playbooks** with expected margin impact ranges
- Enabled price updates without risky A/B tests

---

## Business Value
- Higher pricing confidence at scale
- Faster iteration; decisions grounded in uncertainty-aware estimates
- Transparent logic; no black box

---

## Key Takeaways
- Pooling cures sparsity; combos need explicit treatment
- Seasonality and trend must be modeled to avoid bias
- Ranges, not points, drive better pricing decisions
