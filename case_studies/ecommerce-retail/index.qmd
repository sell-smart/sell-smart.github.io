## Project Overview
A fast-growing Shopify retailer wanted pricing improvements across a large catalog.

- Goal: Higher contribution margins with stable conversion
- Scope: Hundreds of SKUs, multiple categories, international users
- Constraints: Limited history for many items; promo spikes; currency effects

---

## Challenges
- Data sparsity for new/slow movers
- Constant catalog changes
- Promotions confound base price estimates
- Category differences in sensitivity and competition

---

## Solution Approach
- **Hierarchical pooling** across categories/variants to stabilize elasticities
- Separate **promotion effects** to avoid bias
- **WTP curves** by category, updated with competitor snapshots
- Scenario simulations: item, category, and promo timing

---

## Architecture (light)
- Data: Shopify (orders/products/inventory), competitor prices, costs
- Models: Elasticities + WTP curves with uncertainty
- Delivery: Dashboards and CSV exports for bulk updates

---

## Results
- Margin lift on low-elasticity SKUs; price relief on over-elastic items
- Cleaner intra-category price consistency
- Evidence-based promo planning vs guesswork

---

## Business Value
- Higher gross margin without traffic loss
- Faster response to competitor moves
- Operationally simple updates via bulk actions

---

## Key Takeaways
- Partial pooling is essential with limited histories
- Model promos separately
- Competitor alignment + WTP curves guide practical ranges
