## The Challenge

A national coffee chain needed to increase prices but wanted to do it intelligently — not blanket increases across the board. Previous price changes had been made without understanding which products or locations were most price-sensitive, leading to unpredictable volume impacts.

## The Approach

Using POS transaction data, I estimated price elasticity at two levels:

- **Product-level elasticity:** Identified which menu items customers were most and least sensitive to
- **Site-level elasticity:** Measured how price sensitivity varied across locations

This allowed for targeted recommendations:
- Increase prices more aggressively on low-elasticity items
- Protect high-elasticity traffic drivers
- Re-tier sites based on local price sensitivity

### Data Challenges

The data wasn't clean:
- Outlier prices from manual overrides
- Multiple price points appearing at the same site on the same day
- Missing price data for many product-site combinations

These required careful cleaning and validation before modeling.

## The Outcome

The model identified which products could absorb price increases with minimal volume loss, and which sites should move to different pricing tiers. This replaced gut-feel pricing with data-driven recommendations.

## Key Insight

> Not all price increases are equal. A 5% increase on a low-elasticity item might cost you nothing, while the same increase on a traffic driver could hurt footfall across the entire basket.
