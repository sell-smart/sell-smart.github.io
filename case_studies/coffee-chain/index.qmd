## Project Overview
A national coffee chain sought margin improvement without harming transactions.

- Goal: Raise contribution margin; retain core volume
- Scope: Beverages, food add-ons, seasonal items
- Added Objective: **Re-tier store pricing** by location economics

---

## Challenges
- Menu customization → SKU explosion
- Strong seasonality (hot/iced, festive)
- Promotions overlap base price
- Location heterogeneity (format, footfall, costs)

---

## Solution Approach
- **Hierarchical demand models** by category/region with partial pooling
- **Seasonality** (weekly/yearly) and promo controls
- **Tiering framework**: cluster stores by demand profile, cost, competition
- Simulate **re-tiering + item-level** changes with uncertainty bands

---

## Architecture (light)
- Data: POS, costs, promos, store attributes, competitor signals
- Models: Elasticities + store clustering for tier bands
- Delivery: Tier maps; playbooks for seasonal and tier shifts

---

## Results
- Re-tiered stores to reflect local economics
- Seasonal price moves (e.g., iced in summer) with projected impacts
- Reduced blanket % increases; targeted changes instead

---

## Business Value
- Margin lift without detectable volume loss on core lines
- Faster, location-specific pricing adjustments
- Clear uncertainty ranges → better stakeholder acceptance

---

## Key Takeaways
- Dynamic tiering beats one-size-fits-all
- Seasonality and promos must be modeled explicitly
- Pooling strengthens low-volume SKU estimates
