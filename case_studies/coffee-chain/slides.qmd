## The Challenge

A **national coffee chain** needed to increase prices — but not blindly.

::: {.incremental}
- Previous increases were gut-feel, with unpredictable volume impacts
- No understanding of which products or sites were price-sensitive
- Needed a smarter approach
:::

---

## The Approach

Estimated **price elasticity at two levels** using POS transaction data:

::: {.incremental}
- **Product-level:** Which menu items are customers most/least sensitive to?
- **Site-level:** How does price sensitivity vary by location?
- **Re-tiering:** Move sites to appropriate pricing bands
:::

---

## Data Challenges

The data required significant cleaning:

::: {.incremental}
- Outlier prices from manual overrides
- Multiple price points per site per day
- Missing price data for many product-site combinations
:::

## The Outcome

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.metric-card}

Replaced gut-feel pricing with data-driven recommendations.

## Key Insight

> Not all price increases are equal.

A 5% increase on a **low-elasticity item** might cost you nothing.

The same increase on a **traffic driver** could hurt footfall across the entire basket.
