## The Challenge

<!-- 2-3 sentences: What problem did the client face? What was at stake? -->

[Company description] needed to [business problem]. Their existing approach was [current state/pain point], resulting in [negative outcome or missed opportunity].

<!-- Example:
A European grocery retailer with 300+ stores was leaving money on the table
with uniform national pricing. Regional differences in competition and customer
willingness-to-pay weren't reflected in their pricing strategy, leading to
margin erosion in some markets and lost volume in others.
-->


## The Approach

<!-- What did you actually do? Focus on methodology, not tools. -->

I developed [type of solution] that [what it does]. Key elements included:

- **[Element 1]:** [Brief description]
- **[Element 2]:** [Brief description]
- **[Element 3]:** [Brief description]

<!-- Example:
I built a price elasticity model using historical transaction data across
all stores and product categories. Key elements included:

- **Regional segmentation:** Clustered stores by competitive intensity and
  demographic profile to identify distinct pricing zones
- **Category-level elasticity:** Estimated demand sensitivity separately for
  traffic-driving categories vs. margin categories
- **Cannibalization modeling:** Accounted for substitution effects between
  similar products to avoid margin-destroying price wars within the assortment
-->


## The Outcome

<!-- Quantified results. Be specific but honest about what you can claim. -->

The engagement delivered:

- **[Primary metric]:** [X% improvement / €X value]
- **[Secondary metric]:** [Description]
- **[Tertiary benefit]:** [Description]

<!-- Example:
The engagement delivered:

- **8% margin improvement** on optimized categories within 6 months
- **No volume loss** — careful elasticity-based guardrails prevented
  customer defection
- **Scalable framework** — the model now runs monthly, automatically
  flagging repricing opportunities
-->


## Key Insight

<!-- One takeaway that demonstrates your expertise. What would you tell someone facing a similar challenge? -->

> [One-sentence insight that shows depth of thinking]

<!-- Example:
> Uniform pricing feels safe but often leaves significant margin on the table.
> The key is identifying which products customers are price-sensitive on
> (and optimizing for volume) vs. which they'll pay more for (and optimizing
> for margin).
