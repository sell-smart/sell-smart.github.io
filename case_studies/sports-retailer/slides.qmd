## The Challenge

A **major sports retailer** needed ongoing price optimization with constraints:

::: {.incremental}
- Uniform pricing across all channels and locations
- Strict protection required for "key value items"
- Messy, undocumented data
:::

---

## The Approach

**Multiple optimization waves**, each 1-2 months:

::: {.incremental}
- **Elasticity estimation:** Demand models by product
- **KVI protection:** Shield traffic drivers from aggressive increases
- **Business constraints:** Category-specific rules from client
- **Markdown wave:** End-of-life pricing optimization
:::

---

## Data Challenges

The data environment was difficult:

::: {.incremental}
- Most fields undocumented
- Duplicate transactions throughout
- Outdated product lifecycle info (unclear which records)
- Much inferred from patterns, not documentation
:::

---

## The Outcome

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.metric-card}
[5+]{.number}
[Optimization waves]{.label}
:::
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.metric-card}
[1]{.number}
[Markdown wave]{.label}
:::
:::
::::

Each wave balanced margin improvement against volume protection.

## Key Insight

> Price optimization isn't a one-time project.

Markets shift, costs change, competitor behavior evolves.

**Repeated optimization waves catch drift and compound improvements over time.**
