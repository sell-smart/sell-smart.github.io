    "text": "I help companies improve business decisions through statistical modeling — especially in settings where data is messy, opportunities for experimentation are limited, and off-the-shelf solutions fall short.\nMy focus areas include demand modeling, price elasticity estimation, and forecasting. I build bespoke models using Bayesian methods, tailored to the structure of the business problem — particularly when standard tools can’t capture the complexity of real-world decisions.\nI’ve worked across B2C and B2B contexts in close collaboration with various stakeholders — always aiming to understand how the business and sales processes actually work, so models reflect what matters and make the most of limited data.\nOpen to freelance and consulting opportunities involving challenging modeling problems, including pricing optimization and marketing mix modeling.\nLearn more about me →\n\n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
