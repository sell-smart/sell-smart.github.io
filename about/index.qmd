::: {#hero-heading}
<div class="h1">Hi, I’m Pavel Logačev</div>

I help businesses optimize prices and grow revenue with data. That means building models that make pricing decisions — not dashboards that sit unused.

Whether you're a retailer, a B2B supplier, or a direct-to-consumer brand, I work with you (or your agency) to identify pricing opportunities, model demand, and implement pricing logic that scales.  
I don’t just hand you elasticities — I deliver working solutions.

[Get in touch](/contact.qmd) if you’d like to work together.

## What I do

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}

**From pricing guesswork to pricing strategy.**

I support clients with:

- Price optimization (margin or revenue focused)
- Willingness-to-pay modeling — even without clean sales data
- Demand forecasting with uncertainty estimates
- Stockout detection and adjustment
- Competitor benchmarking from scraped or third-party data
- A/B test design and analysis
- Causal inference for pricing, marketing, and product decisions

I help you go from messy historical data to a robust pricing process.

:::

::: {.g-col-6}

**Business-first. Technically fluent.**

I build models that are:

- **Custom-fit to your context**, not off-the-shelf
- Designed for **messy, real-world data**
- Delivered as ready-to-use pricing logic, files, or API endpoints

My goal is always the same: help you charge the right price — confidently, repeatedly, and at scale.

I'm based in Berlin and work with clients across Europe and North America.  
I speak English, German, and Russian.

## Experience

I've worked with retailers, manufacturers, and global brands on pricing problems ranging from product launches to large-scale price realignments.

Past projects have included:

- Rolling out optimized prices across 300+ stores
- Replacing legacy price ladders with margin-based models
- Estimating price elasticity across thousands of SKUs
- Designing experiments to test pricing thresholds

Much of my work is done through agencies — but I operate as a partner, not a hired hand.
